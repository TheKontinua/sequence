\chapter{Vector-valued Functions}

In the last chapter, you calculated the flight of the shell.  For any
time $t$, you could find a vector $[distance, height]$. This can be
thought of as a function $f$ that takes a number and returns a
2-dimensional vector.  We call this a \newterm{vector-valued} function
from $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$.

We often make a vector-valued function by defining several real-valued
functions.  For example, if you threw a hammer with an initial upward
speed of 12 m/2 and a horizontal speed of 4 m/s along the $x$ axis from
the point $(1, 6, 2)$, its position at time $t$ (during its flight) would be given by:

$$f(t) = [4t + 1, 6, -4.8t^2 + 12t + 2]$$

That is, $x$ is increasing with $t$, $y$ is constant, and $z$ is a parabola.

Now that we have its position vector, we can differentiate each
component separately to get its velocity as a vector-valued function:

$$f'(t) = [4, 0, -9.8t + 12]$$

That is, the velocity is constant along the $x$-axis, zero along the
$y$-axis, and decreasing with time along the $z$ axis.

Now that we have its velocity, we can get its acceleration as a vector-valued function:

$$f''(t) = [0, 0, -9.8]$$

There is no acceleration along the $x$ or $y$ axes. It is accerating
down at a constant $9.8 m/s^2$.
