\chapter{Volumes with Integrals}
Suppose we wanted to know the volume of a theoretical irregular shape (we 
stipulate theoretical because, if you had this object and a large enough 
container, you could use displacement to determine the volume of the object).

\section{Volume of a Sphere}
Below we will prove the volume of a sphere is given by $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ 
using the integral method. Suppose we have a sphere of radius $r$ centered at 
the origin (see figure \ref{fig:sphere})

\begin{figure}[htbp]

        \empty, xlabel = $x$, ylabel = $y$]

            \draw[red, fill = red!30, opacity = 0.4] (2, 0) ellipse [x radius 
            = 0.3, y radius = 2.2];

        \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{A vertical cross-section of a sphere}
    \label{fig:sphere}
\end{figure}

We begin by taking very thin vertical cross-sections. The radius of the 
cross-section is the height, $y$, of the sphere at the horizontal position, 
$x$. Since the edges of the cross-section lie on the sphere, we know the edge 
of the cross-section is distance $r$ from the origin. Applying the Pythagorean 
theorem, we see that $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$, which implies that $y = \sqrt{r^2 - x^2
}$. And then the area of the cross-section is given by $\pi y^2 = \pi (r^2 - x^
2)$. If we imagine each cross section as having a width, $dx$, and taking the 
sum of all the cross sections from $x = -r$ to $x = r$, we can write an 
integral equal to the volume of the sphere:
$$V_{sphere} = \int_{-r}^{r} \pi (r^2 - x^2)\,dx$$
And we can evaluate that integral:
$$V_{sphere} = \pi \int_{-r}^{r} r^2\,dx - \pi \int_{-r}^{r} x^2\,dx$$
$$V_{sphere} = \pi \left[ r^2 x \right] _{x = -r}^{x = r} - \frac{\pi}{3} \left[
x^3 \right] _{x = -r}^{x = r} $$
$$V_{sphere} = \pi \left[ r^3 - (-r^3) \right] - \frac{\pi}{3} \left[r^3 - (-r^
3) \right]$$
$$V_{sphere} = 2 \pi r^3 - \frac{2\pi}{3} r^3 = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$$

\begin{Exercise}[label = volume3]
Prove the volume of a regular cone is $\frac{\pi}{3}R^2H$, where $R$ is the 
radius of the base and $H$ is the height of the cone. (Hint: a cone is a series
of decreasing circles stacked on top of each other, see figure below.)

\begin{Answer}[ref = volume3]
Imagine a side view of the cone (see figure below), an isosceles triangle with 
height $H$ and base $2R$. If we take horizontal cross-sections, then each 
cross-section is a circle $h$ from the top with a radius $r$. Because the 
triangles are similar (fix me better wording/explanation here), we also know 
that $\frac{H}{h} = \frac{R}{r}$. Therefore, we can define $r$ in terms of $h$:
$r = \frac{hR}{H}$ and the volume of each subsequent cross-section is $\pi r^2 
dh = \pi \frac{h^2 R^2}{H^2} dh$. We start with $h = 0$ and end with $h = H$:
$$V_{cone} = \int_0^H \pi \frac{h^2 R^2}{H^2}\,dh = \pi \frac{R^2}{H^2} \int_0^
H h^2\,dh$$
$$= \pi \frac{R^2}{H^2} \left[ \frac{1}{3}h^3 \right]_{h = 0}^{h = H} = \pi 
\frac{R^2}{3H^2} \left[H^3 - 0^3 \right]$$
$$= \pi \frac{R^2}{3H^2}H^3 = \frac{\pi}{3} R^2 H$$

\section{Volumes of Solids of Revolution}
We can also find the volume of solids made by revolving a graph about the $x$ 
or $y$-axis. Suppose the graph $y = \sin{x}$ from $x = 0$ to $x = \frac{\pi}{2
}$ were rotated vertically about the $x$-axis to form a solid. How could we 
find the volume of that solid? Well, we can imagine a rectangle of width $dx$ 
and height $y$ (see figure \ref{fig:sine_2d})

\begin{center}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \begin{axis}[axis lines = center, xmin = 0, xmax = 1.75, ymin = 0, 
        ymax = 1.05, clip = false]
          \addplot[name path = A, blue, thick, domain = 0:1.57, samples = 50]{
          sin(deg(x))}; 
          \addplot[name path = B, blue, thick] coordinates {(1.57, 0) (1.57, 1)
          };
          \addplot[blue!30, opacity = 0.4] fill between[ of = A and B];
          \filldraw[draw = red, fill = red!30, opacity = 0.4](1.1, 0) 
          rectangle (1.13, 0.9); 
          \node[] at (1.115, -0.05) {$dx$};
          \draw[] (1.15, 0.01) -- (1.15, 0.89);
          \draw[] (1.14, 0.01) -- (1.16, 0.01);
          \draw[] (1.14, 0.89) -- (1.16, 0.89);
          \node[rotate = -90] at (1.21, 0.5) {height = $y = \sin{x}$};
        \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{A cross section has width $dx$ and height $y = \sin{x}$}
    \label{fig:sine_2d}
\end{figure}
\end{center}

If we rotate the plot vertically about the $x$-axis, the rectangle becomes a 
cylinder with radius $y = \sin{x}$ and height $dx$ (see figure \ref{
fig:sine_3d}). And, therefore, the volume of each cylindrical slice is $V_{
slice} = \pi r^2 dx = \pi \cdot \sin^2{x} dx$. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]

    \begin{tikzpicture}

        \addplot[name path = A, blue, thick, domain = 0:1.57, samples = 50]{
        sin(deg(x))}; 
        \addplot[name path = B, blue, thick, domain = 0:1.57, samples = 50]{
        -sin(deg(x))};
        \draw[blue!30, thick, fill = blue!30, opacity = 0.4] (1.57, 0) ellipse 
        [x radius = 0.2, y radius = 1];
        \draw[red] (1, 0.841) arc [start angle = 90, end angle = 270, x radius 
        = 0.1, y radius = 0.841];
        \draw[red, dashed] (1, -0.841) arc [start angle = -90, end angle = 90,

        x radius = 0.1, y radius = 0.841];
        \draw[blue, thick] (1.57, 1) arc [start angle = 90, end angle = 270, 
        x radius = 0.2, y radius = 1];
        \draw[blue, thick, dashed] (1.57, -1) arc [start angle = -90, 
        end angle = 90, x radius = 0.2, y radius = 1];
        \draw[red] (0.95, 0.841) -- (1, 0.841);
        \draw[red] (0.95, -0.841) -- (1, -0.841);
        \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{When rotated, the cross-section becomes a cylinder with radius $
    \sin{x}$ and width $dx$, which has a total volume of $\pi \sin^2{x} dx$}
    \label{fig:sine_3d}
\end{figure}

We can find the total volume by integrating from $0$ to $\pi/2$:
$$V = \pi \int_0^{\pi/2} \sin^2{x}\,dx$$

Recall the half angle formula, $\sin^2{x} = \frac{1}{2} \left( 1 - \cos{2x} 
\right)$. Substituting, we see that:
$$V = \frac{\pi}{2} \int_0^{\pi/2} \left( 1 - \cos{2x} \right)\,dx$$
$$V = \frac{\pi}{2} \left( x - \frac{1}{2}\sin{2x} \right)|_{x = 0}^{x = \pi/2}$$
$$V = \frac{\pi}{2} \left[ \left( \pi/2 - \frac{1}{2}\sin{\pi} \right) - \left(
0 - \frac{1}{2}\sin{0} \right) \right]$$
$$V = \frac{\pi}{2} \left[ \pi/2 - 0 - 0 + 0 \right] = \frac{\pi^2}{4}$$

\begin{Exercise}[label = volume1]
Find the volume of a solid created by rotating the region bounded by $x = 2
\sqrt{y}$, $x = 0$, and $y = 9$ about the $y$-axis. A graph is shown below.
 
\begin{tikzpicture}

	xmax = 6, clip = false]
	    \addplot[name path = A, blue, thick, domain = 0:6]{(x/2)^2};
            \addplot[name path = B, blue, thick, domain = 0:6]{9};
            \addplot[blue!30, opacity = 0.4] fill between[

	\end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
\vspace{30mm}  
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}[ref = volume1]
If we are rotating about the $y$ axis, we should make our slices horizontal 
so their width is $dy$ (see graph below). Then the volume of each cylinder is 
given by $V = \pi r^2 dy$ and the total volume is given by:
$$V = \int_0^9 \pi \left[2 \sqrt{y} \right]^2\,dy$$
$$V = 4\pi \int_0^9 y\,dy = 2\pi y^2|_{y = 0}^{y = 9}$$
$$V = 2\pi \left(9 \right)^2 = 162\pi$$

\end{Answer}

\begin{Exercise}[label = volume5]
Let $f(x) = (ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d)\sqrt{1-x^2}$. Bird's eggs of various sizes 
can be modeled by rotating $f(x)$ about the $x$-axis, with different values of 
$a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ defining different sizes and shapes of eggs. For a 
domestic chicken, $a = -0.02$, $b = 0.03$, $c = 0.12$, and $d = 0.454$. For a 
mallard duck, $a = -0.06$, $b = 0.04$, $c = 0.1$, and $d = 0.54$. Use a 
calculator, such as a TI-89 or Wolfram Alpha, to determine which species lays 
a bigger egg.  
\vspace{50mm}
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}[ref = volume5]
Since the graph is rotated around the $x$-axis, we will take vertical slices 
with width $dx$ and rotate them to make cylinders with radius $f(x)$ and height
$dx$. Then the volume of each egg is given by:
$$\int_{-1}^1 \pi \left[ f(x) \right]^2\,dx$$

To determine our limits of integration, we note that $\sqrt{1 - x^2} = 0$ (and 
therefore, $f(x) = 0$) when $x = \pm 1$.

For the chicken, 
$$V_{chicken egg} = \pi \int_{-1}^1 \left[ \left(-0.02x^3 + 0.03x^2 + 0.12x + 
0.454 \right) \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right]^2\,dx$$

And for the mallard duck,
$$V_{duck egg} = \pi \int_{-1}^1 \left[ \left( -0.06x^3 + 0.04x^2 + 0.1x + 
0.54 \right) \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right]^2\,dx$$

Using a calculator, we find that $V_{chicken egg} \approx 0.897$ and 
$V_{duck egg} \approx 1.263$. Therefore, mallard ducks lay larger eggs than 
chickens do. 
\end{Answer}

\subsection{Using donuts for solids of revolution}
Sometimes there is space between the region we are rotating and the line we are
rotating it about. Consider the region bounded between $y = 2x$ and $y = x^2$  
(see figure \ref{fig:donut}):

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \begin{axis}[axis lines = center, xmin = 0, xmax = 2, ymin = 0, 
        ymax = 4, clip = false]
          \addplot[name path = A, blue, thick, domain = 0:2]{x^2};
          \addplot[name path = B, blue, thick, domain = 0:2]{2*x};
          \addplot[blue!30, opacity = 0.4] fill between [of = A and B];
          \draw[](1.2, 0) ellipse (0.2cm and 0.5cm);
          \draw[-latex](1.14, 0) -- (1.14, -0.1);
          \draw[draw = red, fill = red!30](1,1) rectangle (1.02, 2);
          \draw[red, dashed](1.01, 1) -- (1.01, 0);
        \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{When rotated, the slices will become donuts with outer radius $2x$
    and inner radius $x^2$}
    \label{fig:donut}
\end{figure}

When rotated, the slices will take the form of donuts (or washers), the volume 
of which is $\pi \left( R^2 - r^2 \right) dx$, where $R$ is the outer radius 
and $r$ is the inner radius. Therefore, in this case, the total volume of the 
rotated region is given by:
$$V = \int_0^2 \pi \left[ \left( 2x \right)^2 - \left(x^2 \right)^2 \right]\,
dx$$
$$V = \pi \int_0^2 4x^2 - x^4\,dx = \pi \left[\frac{4}{3}x^3 - \frac{1}{5}x^5 
\right]_{x = 0}^{x = 2}$$
$$V = \pi \left[\frac{4}{3}2^3 - \frac{1}{5}2^5 \right] = \pi \left[ \frac{32}{
3} - \frac{32}{5} \right] $$
$$V = \frac{64 \pi}{15} $$

\begin{Exercise}[label = volume2]
What is the volume of the region bounded by $y = x^2$ and $y = 2\sqrt{x}$ when 
rotated about the $y$-axis? 
\vspace{75mm}
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}[ref = volume 2]
First, since we are revolving around the $y$-axis, we know our slices will 
have width $dy$. We will re-write the functions as $x$ in terms of $y$:
$$x = \sqrt{y}$$
$$x = \frac{y^2}{4}$$
Setting them equal to each other to find the $y$-value at which they intercept:
$$\sqrt{y} = \frac{y^2}{4}$$
$$4 = \frac{y^2}{\sqrt{y}} = y^{3/2}$$
$$y = \sqrt[3]{4^2} = 2\sqrt[3]{2}$$
Examining a graph (shown below), we see that the outer radius is $x = \sqrt{y}$
and the inner radius is $x = \frac{y^2}{4}$. 

\begin{tikzpicture}
        \begin{axis}[axis lines = center, xmin = 0, xmax = 2, ymin = 0, 
        ymax = 3, clip = false]
          \addplot[name path = A, blue, thick, domain = 0:1.5874, samples = 50]
          {x^2}; 
          \addplot[name path = B, blue, thick, domain = 0:1.5874, samples = 100]
          {(2*sqrt(x)};
          \addplot[blue!30, opacity = 0.4] fill between[ of = A and B];
          \filldraw[draw = red, fill = red!30, opacity = 0.4](0.25, 1) rectangle 
          (1, 1.01); 
          \node[] at (1.115, 1.01) {$dy$};
          \draw[|-|] (0.03, 1.5) -- (0.53, 1.5);
          \draw[|-|] (0.585, 1.5) -- (1.2, 1.5);
          \node[] at (0.25, 1.7) {$r = \frac{y^2}{4}$};
          \node[] at (0.75, 2.5) {$R = \sqrt{y}$};
          \draw[-latex] (0.75, 2.4) -- (0.9, 1.55);
        \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}

Then the total volume of the solid of revolution is given by:
$$V = \pi \int_0^{2\sqrt[3]{2}} \left(\sqrt{y} \right)^2 - \left( \frac{y^2}{4} 
\right)^2\,dy$$
$$V = \pi \int_0^{2\sqrt[3]{2}} \left[ y - \frac{y^4}{16} \right]\,dy$$
$$V = \pi \left[ \frac{1}{2}y^2 - \frac{1}{80}y^5 \right]_{y = 0}^{y = 
2\sqrt[3]{2}}$$
$$V = \pi \left[ \frac{6}{5} 2^{2/3} \right] \approx 5.9844$$
\end{Answer}

\section{Volumes of Other Solids}
You can also model a solid as a base defined by a function with cross-sections 
of specific shapes. Consider the function $y = x^2$ from $x = 0$ to $x = 2$ (
see figure \ref{fig:parab}). Suppose the area between the curve, the $y$-axis, 
and the line $y = 4$ defines a base and each vertical cross-section is a 
square. Then the width of the each cross section is $dx$, the length is $4 - 
x^2$, and (because they are squares) the height in the $z$-plane is also $4 - 
x^2$. Then the volume of each cross-section is $V_{slice} = \left(4 - x^2 
\right)^2 dx$ and the total volume of the solid is:
$$V = \int_0^2 \left(4 - x^2 \right) ^ 2\,dx$$
$$V = \int_0^2 \left( 16 - 8x^2 + x^4 \right)\,dx$$
$$V = \left[16x - \frac{8}{3}x^3 + \frac{1}{5}x^5 \right]_{x = 0}^{x = 2}$$
$$V = 16(2) - \frac{8}{3}(2)^3 + \frac{1}{5}(2)^5 = \frac{256}{15} 
\approx 17.067$$

You can use a similar method for triangular, semi-circular, or any other shape 
cross-section. The trick is writing everything in terms of $x$ (when you cross 
sections are vertical and have width $dx$) or $y$ (when your cross section are 
horizontal and have length $dy$). 

\begin{Exercise}[label=AP_87]
[This question was originally presented as a multiple-choice, calculator-allowed 
question on the 2012 AP Calculus BC exam.] Let $R$ be the region in the first 
quadrant bounded above by the graph $y = \ln{(3 - x)}$, for $0 \leq x \leq 2$. 
$R$ is the base of a solid for which each cross section perpendicular to the 
$x$-axis is square. What is the volume of the solid? Give your answer to 3 
decimal places. 
\vspace{50mm}
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}[ref=AP_87]
If each cross section is a square, then the volume of each cross section is 
given by $s^2 dx$, where $s$ is the side length of the square. Since the side 
length is equal to the distance between the graph of $y$ and the $x$-axis, we 
can see that $s = y = \ln{(3 - x)}$. And, therefore, the total volume of all 
the cross sections is given by $\int_0^2 \left[\ln{(3 - x)} \right]^2\,dx$. 
Using a calculator, this integral evaluates to $\approx 1.029$. 
\end{Answer}

\begin{Exercise}[label = volume6]
Find the volume of a solid whose base is defined by the ellipse $9x^2 + 16y^2 =
25$ and is made up of isosceles-triangular cross-sections perpendicular to the 
$x$-axis (with the hypotenuse in the base of the solid). 
\vspace{40mm}
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}[ref = volume6]
Since the cross-sections are perpendicular to the $x$-axis, they will have 
width $dx$ and we will integrate across the domain of the ellipse. Setting $y =
0$ to find the domain of the ellipse:
$$9x^2 = 25 \to x^2 = \frac{25}{9} \to x = \pm \frac{5}{3}$$

A right isosceles triangle with hypotenuse $h$ has area $\frac{1}{4}h^2$. In 
this case, each triangle's hypotenuse is given by the distance between the top 
and bottom of the ellipse. The top of the ellipse if defined by $y = \frac{1}{4
} \sqrt{25 - 9x^2}$ and the bottom by $y = -\frac{1}{4} \sqrt{25 - 9x^2}$. 
Therefore, the length of each hypotenuse is $\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{25-9x^2}$. 

Then, each cross-section has a total volume of $\frac{1}{4}h^2 dx = \frac{1}{4}
\left( \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{25 - 9x^2} \right)^2 dx$ and the volume of the solid 
is:
$$V_{solid} = \int_{-5/3}^{5/3} \frac{1}{4} \left( \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{25 - 9x^2}
\right)^2 \, dx$$
$$= \frac{1}{4} \int_{-5/3}^{5/3} \frac{1}{4} \left( 25 - 9x^2 \right) \, dx$$
$$= \frac{1}{6} \int_{-5/3}^{5/3} \left( 25 - 9x^2 \right) \, dx = \frac{1}{16}
\left[ 25x - 3x^3 \right]_{x = -5/3}^{x = 5/3}$$
$$= \frac{1}{16} \left[ \left( 25 \left( \frac{5}{3} \right) - 25 \left( \frac{
-5}{3} \right) \right) - \left( 3 \left( \frac{5}{3} \right)^3 - 3 \left( 
\frac{-5}{3} \right)^3 \right) \right]$$
$$= \frac{1}{16} \left[ \frac{250}{3} - \left( \frac{375}{27} + \frac{375}{27} 
\right) \right] = \frac{1}{16} \left[ \frac{250}{3} - \frac{250}{9}\right] = 
\frac{1}{16} \left[  \frac{750}{9} - \frac{250}{9} \right] = \frac{1}{16} 
\left[ \frac{500}{9} \right] = \frac{125}{36}$$
\end{Answer}
