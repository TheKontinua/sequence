\chapter{Singular Value Decomposition}

Singular Value Decomposition is a matrix factorization technique that breaks down a matrix into three matrices that represent the structure and properties of the original matrix.The decomposed matrices make calculations easier and provide insight into the original matrix.

\section{Definition}

For any $m \times n$ matrix $A$, the singular value decomposition is
given by

\begin{equation}
A = U \Sigma V^T
\end{equation}

where:

\begin{itemize}
\item $U$ is an $m \times m$ matrix, and its columns are the
  eigenvectors of $AA^T$. These are the left singular vectors of $A$.

\item $V$ is an $n \times n$ matrix, and its columns are the
  eigenvectors of $A^TA$. These are the right singular vectors of $A$.

\item $\Sigma$ is an $m \times n$ diagonal matrix, and its non-zero
  elements are the square roots of the eigenvalues of both $A^TA$ and
  $AA^T$. These are the singular values of $A$.
\end{itemize}

It's worth noting that the singular values along the diagonal of
$\Sigma$ are arranged in descending order, and $U$ and $V$ are
orthogonal matrices, meaning $U^TU = I$ and $V^TV = I$.

\section{Applications of SVD}

SVD has numerous applications:

\begin{itemize}
\item It's used in machine learning and data science to perform
  dimensionality reduction, particularly through a technique known as
  Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

\item In numerical linear algebra, SVD is used to solve linear
  equations and compute matrix inverses in a more numerically stable
  way.

\item It's used in image compression, where low-rank approximations of
  an image matrix provide a compressed version of the original image.
\end{itemize}

\section{Doing SVD with numpy}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
import numpy as np

# Initialize a 3x3 matrix
A = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Perform singular value decomposition
U, S, VT = np.linalg.svd(A)

print("U:\n", U)
print("S:\n", S)
print("VT:\n", VT)

# To check if the decomposition is correct we can rebuild the original matrix:
S = np.diag(S)

A_rebuilt = U.dot(S.dot(VT))

print("Rebuilt A:\n", A_rebuilt)
\end{lstlisting}
